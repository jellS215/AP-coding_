1. Decrube 3 things humans can do that AI can't do
Ai cannot feel emotions, they do not feel like humans do emotionally. 
Humans can think cognitively, Ai has to be programmed to do things that it is asked to do.
Humans have freedom, Ai takes commands and is programmed with code, they also cant walk and talk freely and when they can its usually flawed.

2. Describe one way Ai can be used to help people? Describe one way Ai can hurt people?
Ai can be used for things like medicine, my teacher had us watch a documentary about Ai and its pros/cons, and they showed Ai being used for medicine and cures.
Ai can also be used to take work load off of people, substituting into jobs so that people don't have to. (though it shouldn't be a permenant switch in my opinion)
Ai can also be used for negative things, giving bad people the creative system of Ai generates bad actions, like disrespecting historical figures with generative Ai.

3. What do you think schools do to integrate Ai in classrooms?
Schools should use Ai for things like asking questions or getting an idea. 
Ai should not be used for entire assignments or for copying.
Ai shouldn't really be used in classroom as it takes away autheticity and real work ethic.
